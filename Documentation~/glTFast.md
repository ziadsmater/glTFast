# glTFast Documentation

*glTFast* enables loading [glTF™ (GL Transmission Format)][gltf] asset files in [Unity][unity].

It focuses on speed, memory efficiency and a small build footprint.

Two workflows are supported

- Load glTF assets at runtime
- Import glTF assets as prefabs into the asset database at design-time in the Unity Editor

Try the [WebGL Demo][gltfast-web-demo] and check out the [demo project](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFastDemo).

## Features

*glTFast* supports the full [glTF 2.0 specification][gltf-spec] and many extensions. It works with Universal, High Definition and the Built-In Render Pipelines on all platforms.

See the [comprehensive list of supported features and extensions](./features.md).

### Workflows

There are four use-cases for glTF within Unity

- Import
    - [Runtime Import/Loading](#runtime-importloading) in games/applications
    - [Editor Import](#editor-import-design-time) (i.e. import assets at design-time)
- Export
    - [Runtime Export](#runtime-export) (save and share dynamic, user-generated 3D content)
    - [Editor Export](#editor-export) (Unity as glTF authoring tool)

![Schematic diagram of the four glTF workflows](./img/Unity-glTF-workflows.png "The four glTF workflows")

#### Runtime Import/Loading

Load and instantiate glTF files at runtime in your game/application via Script or the `GltfAsset` component.

#### Benefits of Runtime Import

- Efficiently load dynamic and/or third-party assets
    - Make use of state-of-the art mesh and texture compression methods, like KTX/Basis Universal, Draco and meshoptimizer.
- No need to re-build your application or Asset Bundles upon Unity version upgrades

*glTF* was specifically designed for vendor-independent transmission and runtime loading and naturally plays its strengths there.

#### Editor Import (Design-Time)

Although primarily designed for runtime, *glTF*'s effective design and its modern, physically-based material definition make it great for most simple DCC (digital content creation) interchange as well.

Read about [usage](#editor-import) below.

##### Benefits of Editor Import

- Less friction between artists and developers due to *glTF* as standardized interface
    - Example: artists don't need to know or follow Unity shader specific conventions and thus developers don't need to instruct them
- Enables adding rich interaction and behaviour to assets (e.g. custom scripts or animation controllers)
- In conjunction with [Editor Export](#editor-export), Unity becomes a complete tool for re-mixing 3D content
- <sup>1</sup>Use default Lit (URP/HDRP) or Standard (Built-in render pipeline) materials

<sup>1</sup>: Not yet supported (see [issue](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast/issues/258))

#### Editor Export

Use the Unity Editor as an authoring tool and export your scenes and GameObjects as *glTFs*.

> Note: This feature is experimental

##### Use-cases for Editor Export

- [Unity runtime loading](#runtime-import-loading)
- Social media sharing
- Use within the [vast glTF eco system][gltf-projects], like third-party viewers or asset pipelines
- Archiving

#### Runtime Export

Allows your Unity-powered application/game to export scenes/GameObjects to glTF at runtime.

##### Use-cases for Runtime Export

- Preserve dynamic, user-generated 3D content
    - Create metaverse-ready 3D snapshots of a current state / game action
    - 3D product configurations (e-commerce)
- Build high level editing and authoring tools with Unity
- Social media sharing

> Note: This feature is coming soon (see [issue](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast/issues/259))

## Usage

You can load a glTF asset from an URL or a file path.

> Note: glTFs are loaded via [UnityWebRequests](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html). File paths have to be prefixed with `file://` in the Unity Editor and on certain platforms (e.g. iOS).

### Runtime Loading via Component

Add a `GltfAsset` component to a GameObject.

![GltfAsset component][gltfasset_component]

### Runtime Loading via Script

```C#
var gltf = gameObject.AddComponent<GLTFast.GltfAsset>();
gltf.url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/Duck/glTF/Duck.gltf";
```

#### Load from byte array

In case you want to handle download/file loading yourself, you can load glTF binary files directly from C# byte[] like so:

```csharp
async void LoadGltfBinaryFromMemory() {
    byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes("/path/to/file.glb");
    var gltf = new GltfImport();
    bool success = await gltf.LoadGltfBinary(data, new Uri(m_Path));
    if (success) {
        success = gltf.InstantiateMainScene(transform);
    }
}
```

> Note: Most users want to load self-contained glTF binary files this way, but `LoadGltfBinary` also takes the original URI of glTF file as second parameter, so it can resolve relative URIs.

### Customize loading behavior

Loading via script allows you to:

- Custom download or file loading behaviour (see [`IDownloadProvider`](../Runtime/Scripts/IDownload.cs))
- Customize loading behaviour (like texture settings) via [`ImportSettings`](#import-settings)
- Custom material generation (see [`IMaterialGenerator`](../Runtime/Scripts/IMaterialGenerator.cs))
- Customize [instantiation](#Instantiation)
- Load glTF once and instantiate its scenes many times (see example [below](#custom-post-loading-behaviour))
- Access data of glTF scene (for example get material; see example [below](#custom-post-loading-behaviour))
- Load [reports](#report) allow reacting and communicating incidents during loading and instantiation
- Tweak and optimize loading performance

#### Import Settings

`GltfImport.Load` accepts an optional instance of [`ImportSettings`](../Runtime/Scripts/ImportSettings.cs) as parameter. Have a look at this class to see all options available. Here's an example usage:

```C#
async void Start() {
    var gltf = new GLTFast.GltfImport();

    // Create a settings object and configure it accordingly
    var settings = new ImportSettings {
        generateMipMaps = true,
        anisotropicFilterLevel = 3,
        nodeNameMethod = ImportSettings.NameImportMethod.OriginalUnique
    };
    
    // Load the glTF and pass along the settings
    var success = await gltf.Load("file:///path/to/file.gltf", settings);

    if (success) {
        gltf.InstantiateMainScene(new GameObject("glTF").transform);
    }
    else {
        Debug.LogError("Loading glTF failed!");
    }
}
```

#### Custom Post-Loading Behaviour

The async `Load` method can be awaited and followed up by custom behaviour.

```C#
async void Start() {
    // First step: load glTF
    var gltf = new GLTFast.GltfImport();
    var success = await gltf.Load("file:///path/to/file.gltf");

    if (success) {
        // Here you can customize the post-loading behavior
        
        // Get the first material
        var material = gltf.GetMaterial();
        Debug.LogFormat("The first material is called {0}", material.name);

        // Instantiate the glTF's main scene
        gltf.InstantiateMainScene( new GameObject("Instance 1").transform );
        // Instantiate the glTF's main scene
        gltf.InstantiateMainScene( new GameObject("Instance 2").transform );

        // Instantiate each of the glTF's scenes
        for (int sceneId = 0; sceneId < gltf.sceneCount; sceneId++) {
            gltf.InstantiateScene(transform, sceneId);
        }
    } else {
        Debug.LogError("Loading glTF failed!");
    }
}
```

#### Instantiation

Creating actual GameObjects (or Entities) from the imported data (Meshes, Materials) is called instantiation.

You can customize it by providing an implementation of `IInstantiator` ( see [source](../Runtime/Scripts/IInstantiator.cs) and the reference implementation [`GameObjectInstantiator`](../Runtime/Scripts/GameObjectInstantiator.cs) for details).

Inject your custom instantiation like so

```csharp
public class YourCustomInstantiator : GLTFast.IInstantiator {
  // Your code here
}
…

  // In your custom post-loading script, use it like this
  gltfAsset.InstantiateMainScene( new YourCustomInstantiator() );
```

#### Logging

When loading a glTF file, glTFast logs messages of varying severity (errors, warnigns or infos). Developers can choose what to make of those log messages. Examples:

- Log to console in readable form
- Feed the information into an analytics framework
- Display details to the users

The provided component `GltfAsset` logs all of those messages to the console by default.  

You can customize logging by providing an implementation of `ICodeLogger` to methods like `GltfImport.Load` or `GltfImport.InstanciateMainScene`.

There are two common implementations bundled. The `ConsoleLogger`, which logs straight to console (the default) and `CollectingLogger`, which stores messages in a list for users to process.

Look into [`ICodeLogger`](./Runtime/Scripts/Logging/ICodeLogger.cs) and [`LogMessages`](./Runtime/Scripts/Logging/LogMessages.cs) for details.

#### Tune loading performance

When loading glTFs, *glTFast* let's you optimize for two diametrical extremes

- A stable frame rate
- Fastest loading time

By default each `GltfAsset` instance tries not to block the main thread for longer than a certain time budget and defer the remaining loading process to the next frame / game loop iteration.

If you load many glTF files at once, by default they won't be aware of each other and collectively might block the main game loop for too long.

You can solve this by using a common "defer agent". It decides if work should continue right now or at the next game loop iteration. *glTFast* comes with two defer agents

- `TimeBudgetPerFrameDeferAgent` for stable frame rate
- `UninterruptedDeferAgent` for fastest, uninterrupted loading

Usage example

```C#
async Task CustomDeferAgent() {
    // Recommended: Use a common defer agent across multiple GltfImport instances!
    // For a stable frame rate:
    IDeferAgent deferAgent = gameObject.AddComponent<TimeBudgetPerFrameDeferAgent>();
    // Or for faster loading:
    deferAgent = new UninterruptedDeferAgent();

    var tasks = new List<Task>();
    
    foreach( var url in manyUrls) {
        var gltf = new GLTFast.GltfImport(null,deferAgent);
        var task = gltf.Load(url).ContinueWith(
            t => {
                if (t.Result) {
                    gltf.InstantiateMainScene(transform);
                }
            },
            TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext()
            );
        tasks.Add(task);
    }

    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
}
```

> Note 1: Depending on your glTF scene, using the `UninterruptedDeferAgent` may block the main thread for up to multiple seconds. Be sure to not do this during critical game play action.

> Note2 : Using the `TimeBudgetPerFrameDeferAgent` does **not** guarantee a stutter free frame rate. This is because some sub tasks of the loading routine (like uploading a texture to the GPU) may take too long, cannot be interrupted and **have** to be done on the main thread.

### Editor Import

You can move/copy *glTF* files into your project's *Assets* folder, similar to other 3D formats. *glTFast* will import them to native Unity prefabs and add them to the asset database.

![Editor Import][import-gif]

Don't forget to also copy over companion buffer (`.bin`) and image files! The file names and relative paths cannot be changed, otherwise references may break.

Select a glTF in the Project view to see its import settings and eventual warnings/errors in the Inspector. Expand it in the Project View to see the imported components (Scenes, Meshes, Materials, AnimationClips and Textures).


### Editor Export

#### Export from the Main Menu

The main menu has a couple of entries for export under `File > Export`:

- `Scene (glTF)` exports the entire active scene to glTF (`.gltf` plus external buffer and texture files)
- `Scene (glTF-Binary)` exports the entire active scene to glTF-Binary (`.glb`)
- `Selection (glTF)` exports the currently selected GameObject (with its hierarchy) to glTF (`.gltf` plus external buffer and texture files)
- `Selection (glTF-Binary)` exports the currently selected GameObject (with its hierarchy) to glTF-Binary (`.glb`)

Clicking any of these will open a file selection dialog. If additional files are to be generated (e.g. a buffer or image files) and there's a conflict (i.e. an existing file in that location), a follow-up dialog will as for permission to overwrite.

#### Export via Script

> Note: The `GLTFast.Export` namespace can only be used if you reference both `glTFast` and `glTFast.Export` Assemblies in your [Assembly Definition][asmdef].

To export a GameObject hierarchy/scene from script, create an instance of `GLTFast.Export.GameObjectExport`,
add content via `AddScene` and finally call `SaveToFileAndDispose` to export to a file.

```c#
using UnityEngine;
using GLTFast.Export;

public class TestExport : MonoBehaviour {

    [SerializeField]
    string path;

    async void SimpleExport() {

        // Example of gathering GameObjects to be exported (recursively)
        var rootLevelNodes = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("ExportMe");
        
        // GameObjectExport lets you create glTFs from GameObject hierarchies
        var export = new GameObjectExport();

        // Add a scene
        export.AddScene(rootLevelNodes);

        // Async glTF export
        bool success = await export.SaveToFileAndDispose(path);

        if(!success) {
            Debug.LogError("Something went wrong exporting a glTF");
        }
    }
}
```

After calling `SaveToFileAndDispose` the GameObjectExport instance becomes invalid. Do not re-use it.

Further, the export can be customized by passing settings and injectables to the `GameObjectExport`'s
constructor:

```c#
using UnityEngine;
using GLTFast;
using GLTFast.Export;

public class TestExport : MonoBehaviour {

    [SerializeField]
    string path;

    async void AdvancedExport() {

        // CollectingLogger lets you programatically go through
        // errors and warnings the export raised
        var logger = new CollectingLogger();

        // ExportSettings allow you to configure the export
        // Check its source for details
        var exportSettings = new ExportSettings {
            format = GltfFormat.Binary,
            fileConflictResolution = FileConflictResolution.Overwrite
        };

        // GameObjectExport lets you create glTFs from GameObject hierarchies
        var export = new GameObjectExport( exportSettings, logger: logger);

        // Example of gathering GameObjects to be exported (recursively)
        var rootLevelNodes = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("ExportMe");

        // Add a scene
        export.AddScene(rootLevelNodes, "My new glTF scene");

        // Async glTF export
        bool success = await export.SaveToFileAndDispose(path);

        if(!success) {
            Debug.LogError("Something went wrong exporting a glTF");
            // Log all exporter messages
            logger.LogAll();
        }
    }
}
```

## Project Setup

### Materials and Shader Variants

For runtime import *glTFast* uses custom shader graphs or shaders for rendering glTF materials. Depending on the properties of a glTF material (and extensions it relies on), a specific [shader variant][shader-variants] will get used. In the Editor this shader variant will be built on-demand, but in order for materials to work in your build, you **have** to make sure all shader variants that you're going to need are included.

Including all possible variants is the safest approach, but can make your build very big. There's another way to find the right subset, if you already know what files you'll expect:

- Run your scene that loads all glTFs you expect in the editor.
- Go to Edit->Project Settings->Graphics
- At the bottom end you'll see the "Shader Preloading" section
- Save the currently tracked shaders/variants to an asset
- Take this ShaderVariantCollection asset and add it to the "Preloaded Shaders" list

An alternative way is to create placeholder materials for all feature combinations you expect and put them in a "Resource" folder in your project.

Read the documentation about [`Shader.Find`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Shader.Find.html) for details how to include shaders in builds. It's also recommended to learning more about [shader variants][shader-variants].

Depending on the Unity version and render pipeline in use, different shader graphs or shaders will be used.

- Shader graphs under `Runtime/Shader` for
  - Universal render pipe 12 or newer
  - High-Definition render pipe 10 or newer
  - Built-In render pipe *if* the Shader Graph package 12 or newer is installed
- Shader graphs in folder `Runtime/Shader/Legacy` for older Universal / High-Definition render pipe versions
- Shaders in folder `Runtime/Shader/Built-In` for the built-in render pipeline

#### Shader Graphs and the Built-In Render Pipeline

> This approach is experimental and has know shading issues

Built-In render pipe projects can optionally use the shader graphs instead of the Built-In shaders by:

- Installing Shader Graph version 12 or newer
- Adding `GLTFAST_BUILTIN_SHADER_GRAPH` to the list of scripting define symbols in the project settings

### Readable Mesh Data

By default glTFast discards mesh data after it was uploaded to the GPU to free up main memory (see [`markNoLongerReadable`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.UploadMeshData.html)). You can disable this globally by using the scripting define `GLTFAST_KEEP_MESH_DATA`.

Motivations for this might be using meshes as physics colliders amongst [other cases](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh-isReadable.html).

### Safe Mode

Arbitrary (and potentially broken) input data is a challenge to software's robustness and safety. Some measurements to make glTFast more robust have a negative impact on its performance though.

For this reason some pedantic safety checks in glTFast are not performed by default. You can enable safe-mode by adding the scripting define `GLTFAST_SAFE` to your project.

Enable safe-mode if you are not in control over what content your application may end up loading and you cannot test up front.

### Disable Editor Import

By default, *glTFast* provides Editor import for all files ending with `.gltf` or `.glb` via a `ScriptedImporter`.
If you experience conflicts with other packages that are offering `.gltf`/`.glb` import as well (e.g. [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity][MRTK]) or you simply want to disable Editor import,
add `GLTFAST_EDITOR_IMPORT_OFF` to the *Scripting Define Symbols* in the *Player Settings* and this feature will be turned off. 

## Upgrade Guides

### Upgrade to 4.x

#### Coordinate system conversion change

When upgrading from an older version to 4.x or newer the most notable difference is the imported models' orentation. They will appear 180° rotated around the up-axis (Y).

![GltfAsset component][gltfast3to4]

To counter-act this in applications that used older versions of *glTFast* before, make sure you rotate the parent `Transform` by 180° around the Y-axis, which brings the model back to where it should be.

This change was implemented to conform more closely to the [glTF specification][gltf-spec-coords], which says:

> The front of a glTF asset faces +Z.

In Unity, the positive Z axis is also defined as forward, so it makes sense to align those and so the coordinate space conversion from glTF's right-handed to Unity's left-handed system is performed by inverting the X-axis (before the Z-axis was inverted).

#### New Logging

During loading and instantiation, glTFast used to log messages (infos, warnings and errors) directly to Unity's console. The new logging solution allows you to:

- Omit glTFast logging completely to avoid clogging the message log
- Retrieve the logs to process them (e.g. reporting analytics or inform the user properly)

See [Logging](#logging) above.

#### Scene based instantiation

glTFast 4.0 introduces scene-based instantiation. While most glTF assets contain only one scene they could consist of multiple scenes and optionally have one of declared the default scene.

The old behaviour was, that all of the glTF's content was loaded. The new interface allows you to load the default scene or any scene of choice. If none of the scenes was declared the default scene (by setting the `scene` property), no objects are instantiated (as defined in the glTF specification).

[`GltfImport`][GltfImport] (formerly named `GLTFast`) provides the following properties and methods for scene instantiation:

```csharp
// To get the number of scenes
public int sceneCount;
// Returns the default scene's index
public int? defaultSceneIndex;
// Methods for instantiation
public bool InstantiateMainScene( Transform parent );
public bool InstantiateMainScene(IInstantiator instantiator);
public bool InstantiateScene( Transform parent, int sceneIndex = 0);
public bool InstantiateScene( IInstantiator instantiator, int sceneIndex = 0 );
```

Please look at [`GltfAsset`][GltfAsset] for a reference implementation and look at the properties'/methods' XML documentation comments in the source code for details.

#### Custom material generation

Creating a custom `IMaterialGenerator` was mainly about implementing the following method:

```csharp
Material GenerateMaterial(Schema.Material gltfMaterial, ref Schema.Texture[] textures, ref Schema.Image[] schemaImages, ref Dictionary<int, Texture2D>[] imageVariants);
```

You'd receive all textures/images/image variants to pick from. This was changed to:

```csharp
Material GenerateMaterial(Schema.Material gltfMaterial, IGltfReadable gltf);
```

[`IGltfReadable`][IGltfReadable] is an interface that allows you to query all loaded textures and much more, allowing more flexible implementations. Please look at the source code.

In the future materials can be created before textures are available/downloaded to speed up the loading.

## Implementation details

*glTFast* uses [Unity's JsonUtility](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/JsonUtility.html) for parsing, which has little overhead, is fast and memory-efficient (See <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JSONSerialization.html>).

It also uses fast low-level memory copy methods, [Unity's Job system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html), [Mathematics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.0/manual/index.html), the [Burst compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.6/manual/index.html) and the [Advanced Mesh API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.html).
